Screener.in Notebook Highlighter with Tampermonkey
This script automatically opens the Notebook on a stock page at screener.in, checks if you’ve marked the stock with a "NO" in your notes, and turns the entire page red if found — helping avoid re-analysis of rejected stocks.

If the note contains "NO" (capital), the background turns red instantly! 🔴
